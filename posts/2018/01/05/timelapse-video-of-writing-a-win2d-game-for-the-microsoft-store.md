Probably of no interest to anybody (apart from my son who I did it for), but here’s a timelapse video converting Pac-Man from TypeScript [(play it here)](http://pacman.backroomsoftware.com) to C# for the Windows 10 Store. When it’s finished, I’ll put the source up and describe what I learnt during the process. [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/53ATADjBTSg).

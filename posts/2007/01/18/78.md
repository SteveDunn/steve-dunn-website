<span style="font-size:130%;">**A New Version of Microsoft Terminal Services Client (Remote Desktop)**</span>

Version 6 of MSTSC now supports **<u>multiple monitors(!)</u>** as well as wide-screen resolutions and other features that I haven’t yet tried. This is the version that comes with Vista but it’s worth noting that there is a [download for Windows XP SP2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=26f11f0c-0d18-4306-abcf-d4f18c8f5df9&DisplayLang=en) and [Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=CC148041-577F-4201-B62C-D71ADC98ADB1&displaylang=en). It’s also worth noting that the new features are only available **if the machine you’re connecting <u>to</u> is Vista or Longhorn Server**.

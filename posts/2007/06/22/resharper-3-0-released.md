The new release of [ReShaper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) has a great set of [new features](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/newfeatures.html) and seems to be very stable. The only downside: it doesn’t yet run in Visual Studio 2008 (Orcas). This is planned for version 4.0 which is planned for release at the end of the year. The lack of ReSharper may just put off beta testing the new Visual Studio. If I hear of how to get it to work, I’ll post it here.

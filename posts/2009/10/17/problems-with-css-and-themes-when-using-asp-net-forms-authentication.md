A while back, I wrote a [blog post](https://blog.dunnhq.com/posts/2006/10/20/problems-with-forms-authentication-and-asp-net-themes/) about how turning on Forms Authentication caused problems with stylesheets and Themes. A lot of people found this post useful but had trouble finding it. One reader suggested I change the title to get more hits. So, I did, and this is it.

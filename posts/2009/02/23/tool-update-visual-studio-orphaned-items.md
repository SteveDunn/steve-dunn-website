A while back I did a small simple tool to find files on disk that were once part of a Visual Studio project but are now orphaned (removed from the project but still on disk and in your source repository). Iâ€™ve just updated it to find obsolete files from Visual Studio 2008 projects. You can download the app or the installer, or the source (or all of them!). The installer adds a right-click context menu action for .csproj files in Windows Explorer.

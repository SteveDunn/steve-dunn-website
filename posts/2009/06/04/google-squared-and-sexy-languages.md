[Google Squared](http://www.google.com/squared) looks like an interesting tool.

> *“Google Squared is a search tool that helps you quickly build a collection of facts from the Web for any topic you specify.*
> 
> - *Facts about your topic are organized as a table of items and attributes (we call them "Squares" for fun).*
> - *Customize these Squares to see just the items and attributes you’re interested in.*
> - *See the websites that served as sources for the information in your Square.*
> - *Save and share Squares with others.”*

There’s some interesting results. I searched for [‘programming languages’](http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=programming+languages#).

It displays a list of languages, a picture of the language, a description, and what it was influenced by.

I was very surprised to see the **Miranda** language (apparently influenced by Haskell). Try it yourself: scroll down to Miranda. I must take a closer look at this one!

Scroll down and take a look (but be careful if you’re at work!!). Apparently influenced from Stackless Python. I’d say more like alcohol!
